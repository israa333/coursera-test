**Folder Structure:**

* **module2-solution** (or similar name): This folder will contain all the files for your assignment.

**Additional Notes:**

* Use comments in your HTML and CSS code to explain your code's functionality.
* Refer to the provided mockup illustrations for layout and design guidance.
